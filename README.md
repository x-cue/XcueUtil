# xcue Util

This mod will be updated to contain various random util while I learn the Hytale API!  
If you have any questions, you can reach out to me **.xcue** on discord!

## Commands

#### /hello
> Receive back one of 3 greetings from the server

### Home System
This is a system exactly like the popular Minecraft homes.  
Players can create "homes" that will save locations for them to teleport back to.

#### /home [name]
> Teleport to one of your named homes. If no name is provided, the default is "home"

#### /delhome <name>
> Deletes a player's named home

#### /sethome [name]
> Sets a named home at the player's current location. If no name is provided, the default is "home"
